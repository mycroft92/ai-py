This is a python fork of [Victor Taelin's AI-Scripts](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/AI-scripts). A near verbatim copy of their JS scripts. As such it is currently in development and is licensed under the same MIT license as that of Victor's scripts.
The purpose of this repo is to try a bunch of models with freedom to modify scripts in a language that everyone can understand.
